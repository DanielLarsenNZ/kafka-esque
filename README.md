# kafka-esque
Totally kafkaesque fake Kafka library for Node.js

Fakes a limited set of Kafka-esque functionality as implemented by the [kafka-node](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node) client library. Intended for rapid prototyping or minimal message queue support when the intent is to drop Kafka in at a later stage.
