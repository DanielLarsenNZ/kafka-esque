# kafka-esque
_Totally kafkaesque_ fake-Kafka client library for Node.js

Simulates a limited set of Kafka-esque functionality via a [kafka-node](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node)-like client library. Intended for rapid prototyping, training or a minimalist message queue implementation where the intent is to replace _kafka-esque_ with _kafka-node_ (or a similar client library) at a later stage.
